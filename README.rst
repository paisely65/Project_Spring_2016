1. Project Summary
====================

Electronic Patient Records System (EPRS) will capture patient personal data and
patient care related data at point of service in the respective units/
departments. No imports are needed to run the files. Simply run the code and call the functions in your terminal. In some cases You may need to copy a template into your browser and enter information that you can use to test the code. 

2. Persona
=============

1. **Name**: Becky Cornell
2. **Details**: Mrs. Cornell has been the Director of the Human Resource
   Department at Interfaith Children’s Medical Center and has received
   numerous awards for her work in recruiting and managing the affairs of a
   500 bed children’s hospital. She will be a key stakeholder in the
   implementation of electric health records for the hospital.  She holds a
   B.S. IN Finance and a M.S. in Organizational Psychology.
   The human resource (HR) department oversees the recruitment, safety,
   employees relations, compensation and benefits, compliance, training and
   development. The implementation of an Electronic Patient Records System
   (EPRS) system is within the scope of this department and hence communication
   and compliance with the policies of the HR department is essential to the
   success of the EPRS project.

3. **Goals**: To oversee the training and implementation of the new Electronic
   Patient Records System

1. **Name**: Mike Smith
2. **Details**: Mike has been the working in Information Technology(IT) for
   over sixteen (16) years. He manages the IT Department at Interfaith
   Children’s Medical Center and has a track record for reliable service within
   the company. Mike manages a department of twelve employees. He holds a B.S.
   in Information Systems and a M.S. in Data Analytics.
   He also works as a consultant to organizations that need to improve their
   existing IT infrastructure.  His role in the implementation of the EHR will
   be to work with stakeholders to select appropriate hardware and software,
   design a user interface and set up a training program for employees at the
   hospital.
3. **Goals**: Develop a timeline and structure for training authorized
   employees to us the new system. Design a user interface for the system.
   Create packets and other supporting materials for the training.

Goals of the IT Department
============================

1. Create a strategy to manually input data
2. Create an archive of patient files dated more than three years prior.
3. Ensure that all team members are trained to input data into new electronic
   system
4. Continuously integrate with all stakeholders in the project
5. Monitor stakeholder engagement in the project
6. Complete the project within the six(6) month timeframe
7. To have administrative processes organized, efficient, and well documented
8. To create clinical workflows that are efficient, clearly mapped out, and
   understood by all staff
9. To develop a data collection and reporting processes well established and
   documented?
10. To have staff members that are computer literate and comfortable with
    information technology
11. To keep high speed internet in the office
12. Does the practice have specialty specific requirements?

Goals of the HR Department
============================
1. Maintain compliance with state and Federal Regulations
2. To create clinical workflows that are efficient, clearly mapped out, and
   understood by all staff
3. To develop a data collection and reporting processes well established and
   documented?
4. Generate the financial capital needed to support the project.

3. Problem Scenario
====================

One of the main problems of the manual recording systems in the medical office
is the inconsistency in data entry.

1. **Current Alternatives**: Scan documents to computer
2. **Value Proposition**: Have a system for clinicians to enter data during
   their shift, that is easily available to other authorized individuals
   responsible for managing patient care.

Another major problem with paper based record systems Medical Errors made
when clinicians make decisions based on incomplete data and fragmented patient
records.

1. **Current Alternatives**: Clinicians thoroughly check medical records and
   data before charts are transferred from the patients’ bedside.
2. **Value Proposition**: Misdiagnosis can be avoided if care is taken to
   consult with all members of the team to ensure that all patient data has
   been taken into account before any major clinical decisions are made.

4. User Stories
==============
As manager in the finance department, I want to oversee the financial and
organizational aspect of the Electronic Patient Records System (EPRS)
installation so that must it will be carried out in the most efficient manner
possible.

As the head of Pediatrics I want to design the user interface so that space is
there for all pertinent information is entered in a format that is simple to
access but also maintains he security and integrity of the data and I will
be able to access it locally.

As the project manager I want to coordinate this project so that it has a
successful initiation, coordinated planning and design stages, along with
timely execution and closure. By doing this I will create a product is that
satisfies the initial objectives set forth by the stakeholders.

As a clerical personnel in the hospital I want to transfer the data from
hardcopy and other digital form into the new system so that I can properly
support physicians and other healthcare providers when they need me to access
information.

As a senior nurse practitioner and stakeholder in the installation process,
I will be provide the necessary clinical assessment information to be entered
in the database so that I will be able to access it when it is installed
and I will be able to can record symptoms and diagnoses accurately.

5. Acceptance Stories
=======================

Scenario 01:
---------------
**Finance Director Managing Expenses:**
Given a budget that allows for all expenses in the project
And gives a margin for other unexpected expenses.
When other stakeholders submit invoices for approval
Then I will liaise with the personnel in the finance department
And submit my final decision on whether the finance request is approved or
denied.

Scenario 02:
---------------
**Chief of staff contributes to design of User Interface:**
Given opportunity to contribute towards the design and testing phase of the
project, and communicate my findings to the rest of the department.
When the new EHR system is implemented. Then my I will be ready to deal with
any nuances that may occur and other clinicians will also be informed of ways
to circumvent any unavoidable snags in the system.

Scenario 03:
--------------
**Project Managers Experience Oversight:**
Given approval to begin process, then I will begin making a project charter.
When all stakeholders are aware of the scope of the project and their potential
role in its implementation. Then I outline the team operating principles so
that everyone is aware of the level of commitment required for the project
and detailed responsibilities will be given out to stakeholders.

Scenario 04:
--------------
**Clerical Staff transfers data into new system:**
Given approval of the project, then I will begin data from hard copy and other
digital sources to the new system. When the data transfer has ben complete
Then I would develop methods to move seamlessly from archives to current
records on the database. And I would be able to auspiciously use the new system.
